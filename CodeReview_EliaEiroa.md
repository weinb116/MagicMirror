On a scale of 1 to 5, I give this code a rating of __4__ based on the following criteria:

1  The program has syntax errors and does not compile, or the project does not provide sufficient information to instal necessary dependencies.
2  The program compiles successfully but generates runtime errors. or the project does not contain sufficeint instructions to run the program.
3  The program compiles and runs but does not perform correctly and does not produce correct results
4  The program compiles and produces correct output but does not follow assignment/class guidelines or is insufficiently documented
5  The program produces correct output and is well written and well documented

Suggestions for improving the project:
the FacebookAPI.java would not compile so I couldn't really test it out, I tried to see if I could debug but I didn't find a solution. I know Sean also had this problem, so I don't know if it's us or the code. For improvements, I would add some more detailed instructions of how you want the code compiled and ran.
I love this idea and I think it is really cool that you guys were able to do it in such little time.
